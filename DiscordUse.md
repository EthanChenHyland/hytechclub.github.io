# Discord Use
Hy-Tech Club will use [Discord](https://discord.com/) as a way for students and instructors to communicate outside of the club meeting time.

## Parental Consent Form Agreement 
As noted in the parental consent form that was signed by Parents or Guardians prior to participating in Hy-Tech Club, each student has agreed to the following regarding the use of Discord: 

>I agree and understand that Hyland may provide for the use of certain unaffiliated third party websites or applications (“Third Party Sites”) in connection with the Program. I understand that use of these Third Party Sites is optional. If I choose to permit my child(ren) to use such Third Party Sites, I further understand and agree that: (i) the Third Party Site may collect personal information directly from my child(ren) subject to the terms and conditions (including an applicable privacy policy) available on the Third Party Site; and (ii) Hyland does not control these Third Party Sites and is not responsible for their information collection practices. 

## Additional Guidelines
- The usage of Discord is **not** required. If you do not want to use it, you will still be able to participate in Hy-Tech Club.
- You must use your _real first and last name_ when communicating on Discord. If we see an account that does not have a real student name, the account will be kicked out.
- If you say anything inappropriate, you will be banned from the server and may be removed from Hy-Tech Club.
- Please be respectful of all students and instructors while communicating on Discord.
- Instructors will check Discord throughout the week during business hours, so feel free to post any time!

## Server Categories & Channels
Unlike previous semesters, this semester will only have _one_ Discord Server for the whole of Hy-Tech Club. This means that students will be able to interact across courses.

There are several channels in the server. Please be mindful of each channel's purpose.

### ALL Category
Channels in the **ALL** category are available to _all_ students in Hy-Tech Club, from any course.

#### announcements
Instructors will post important messages in this channel. Students will not be able to post.

#### chat
Students can use this channel to connect with each other socially. Conversations should be appropriate and relevant to the club, and can be a good way for students to get to know each other.

#### code-sharing
Students should use this channel to share what they have built. If there is anything you want to show off, feel free to post it!

### Course-Specific Categories
There will be one category for each course. Each of these categories will contain channels specific to the students and instructors from the course.

#### general
This channel is reserved for general chat. It should mainly be used for conversations about Hy-Tech Club.

#### questions
Students should ask questions related to course material in this channel. Instructors (and other students) will do their best to answer these questions. Note that the answers to the questions should be focused on learning; try to use leading questions or background explanations rather than simply providing a code solution.
