# Recreational Activities
Sometimes, it can be beneficial to facilitate games or activities that are less focused on education, and more focused on fun. These can help students bond with each other, and can be a way to engage disinterested students on some level. In some cases, they can be tied back to the curriculum; in other cases, they can be presented just for fun. Here are some of the activities we've done:

- [Gartic Phone](https://garticphone.com/): online [Telestrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telestrations) (basically, [telephone](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-the-Telephone-Game) with pictures)
