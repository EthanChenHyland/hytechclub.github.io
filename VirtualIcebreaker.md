## Drawing
Once everything is all set up, start drawing! Feel free to draw anything appropriate. Some ideas:

- One of your favorite hobbies
- One of your favorite fictional characters
- A historical figure you admire
- An object you use every day
- Anything else!

## Sharing
After about five minutes, you will be asked to [share your screen](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen-content-or-second-camera). Each student will introduce themselves, and tell the group what they drew.
