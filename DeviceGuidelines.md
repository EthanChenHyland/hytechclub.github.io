# Device Guidelines for Zoom Meetings
We encourage you to use whatever device setup works best for you. That said, we also ask that all students follow some basic guidelines when joining the Zoom meetings.

## Webcams
We understand that not all students have webcams, but if you do, please keep your webcam **on**. This makes it much easier for your instructors to teach.

We ask that you either:
- Turn on your video
- Set a profile picture for your Zoom account

This will help the instructors get to know you better on an individual basis.

### Virtual Background
If you would like, check out [this guide](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/210707503-Virtual-Background#:~:text=Zoom%20desktop%20client.-,Click%20Settings.,image%20by%20clicking%20%2BAdd%20Image.) to see how you can add a virtual background to your video.

### Profile Picture
If you do not have a webcam, check out [this guide](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201363203-Customizing-your-profile) to see how you can change the picture on your profile. [Click here](https://zoom.us/profile) to go to your profile online.

## Microphones
We understand that some students may not have microphones. If you do not have a microphone, you can [call in](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362663-Joining-a-meeting-by-phone) to the Zoom meeting on a regular telephone. This will enable instructors and students to converse with less difficulty.

### During Lectures and Code-Along Activities
Microphones should stay **muted** during lectures and code-along activities. This will help every student learn more effectively. If an instructor asks a question to the class during these activities, please **unmute** your microphone to answer rather than typing into the chat.

### Chat
Chat should be used to ask questions when microphones are muted. If microphones are _not_ muted, please do **not** use chat to converse. It is much easier to have a conversation through audio than through chat.

## Multiple Devices
It may make sense for you to use multiple devices: one to write code, and one to watch the Zoom meeting. This will give you more room to write code while still viewing the instructor's screen. It is not required, but it may make your experience better overall.

If you decide to use multiple devices, we ask that you connect to Zoom on both devices. This way, you will be able to share your screen from your coding computer while watching the meeting on the other device. Please ensure that only **one** microphone is unmuted throughout the meeting to avoid interference.
