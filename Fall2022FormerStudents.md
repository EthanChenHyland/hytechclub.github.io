## Fall 2022 Course Offerings 
- **Web 101:** HTML & CSS
- **Web 102:** JavaScript
- **Software Development Capstone**

_The above course offerings are subject to change based on enrollment for Fall 2022. If there are not enough students to fill a course section, the course may be cancelled and students will be notified._

### Software Development Capstone
In the capstone course, students will work on one long-term project for the entirety of the semester. There may be some instructor-led lessons scattered throughout the course, but most of the time will be spent working individually or as teams to build software applications.

This semester, the course may be offered to a wider variety of students than it has in the past. Traditionally, this has been a more advanced course. However, we may allow any former student to participate, given that they are self-motivated, hard-working, and up for the challenge. Should a student wish to apply for Capstone, the Tech Outreach team will consult with the student's former instructors to determine if the student would be a good fit for the course. There may be additional skill assessments given as well.

We may recommend students retake a course to ensure all students fully understand what they are learning. We do not intend to move students forward just to move them forward. We are truly invested in making sure you have a valuable experience in Hy-Tech Club, and hope you feel we are setting you up for success. If you have any questions regarding your course placement for this semester, please do not hesitate to send us an e-mail.

### Required Student Resources for Virtual Students
In order to successfully participate in Virtual Hy-Tech Club, students must have access to the following:

- **Internet**
- **Laptop, desktop PC or Chromebook**
  - A Chromebook screen may make it difficult to watch the Zoom meeting and code at the same time. A second device may be recommended in order to do both at the same time. 
- **Microphone or other audio equipment**
  - If students don't have a microphone attached to their computer, they are required to connect to audio via phone. 

**Applications open on Monday, August 15th. Applications are due by 11:59PM ET Tuesday, September 13th, 2022.** Students will be sent a confirmation that their application has been received (<ins>via the e-mail addresses on their application</ins>) within 5-7 business days of their submission. We will review all applications and consult with your former instructors _(if applicable)_ to make sure the best decision is made for your learning path. Our goal is to make decisions as quickly as possible, so everyone has enough time to plan for the upcoming semester. **The semester will start on Tuesday, September 20th, 2022.**

Applications are open to the public, and we encourage you to tell your friends & family about Hy-Tech Club. Please direct them to [www.hyland.com/techoutreach](https://hyland.com/techoutreach) for more information.
