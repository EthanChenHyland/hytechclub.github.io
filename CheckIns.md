# Check-Ins
During Hy-Tech Club, **check-ins** are a way for instructors to learn more about students on an individual basis, and see how to best serve them moving forward.

## What
Check-ins are conversations between one individual student and two instructors; this follows the "no one-on-one" rule. Check-ins can and should be student-driven as much as possible, but instructors should be equipped to lead. They should last around 5 minutes depending on the students and the class size.

## When
Typically, check-ins take place at some point around the middle of a Hy-Tech Club semester. A full session should be allocated for check-ins, so students should not miss any crucial information. Instructors can switch off leading check-ins, but at least one instructor should be supervising the classroom at all times.

## Where
In-person, taking a walk around the building is a good way to ease some of the tension and help the discussion flow. Virtually, students and instructors should head into a breakout room.

## Why
Check-ins should help instructors get to know students better on a personal _as well as_ academic level. Fostering these relationships will help instructors help each student in a more personalized way moving forward. Instructors will also be able to gauge the pace of the course, how certain students feel about the material, and how to drive engagement.

## How
Follow these processes during check-in week.

### Introduction
Before facilitating the check-ins, make sure to introduce them appropriately. Students should understand their purpose, and be prepared for the conversations. They may be a little worried to have an individual conversation like this; they should be reassured that this is simply for us to see how they are doing, and see if there are ways we can improve their experience. They are _not_ designed to be confrontational or disciplinary in any way whatsoever!

### Classroom Flow
First, let students ease into the session and start their self-paced work. Establish a clear order for the check-ins (e.g., first row first, left-to-right, etc). Call on the next student in the order, and have two instructors pull them out of the classroom (or into a breakout room).

### Conversation
Start with a brief re-explanation of the check-in process and purpose. Open it up to the students to see if there is anything they would like to discuss; if there is, let them lead the conversation. This is an opportunity for them to talk to us directly, in a way they may not feel comfortable doing in the full classroom. Make sure to listen to whatever they have to say intently.

If the student is not talking much, pull from the **question bank** (below) to guide the conversation.

Take notes during the conversation; for example, if they mention they have a certain hobby, or if they mention a particular lesson they enjoyed, or a particular struggle they might have, write it down! Anything they say might come in handy for the rest of the semester.

## Question Bank
If the conversation is stagnant, these questions can be a great place to get the ball rolling. Feel free to pull from any of these.

### Social-Emotional Guided Questions
These questions are more about the students as people, rather than "students" (even though they are students).

-	How are you doing right now?
-	What have you been doing outside of school and Hy-Tech Club?
-	How is XXXX going? (e.g., dance, band, soccer, etc.)
-	Have you been doing any self-care lately? (e.g., fun things, relaxing activities, etc.)
- What has been on your mind lately?

### Academic Guided Questions
These questions are more about the educational aspects of the club.

-	How has this course been going for you?
-	What have we covered so far that you feel you really understand?
-	What have we covered so far that you still have questions about?
-	What challenges have you had?
    - How have you overcome those challenges?
-	How has the workload been?
-	How is the pacing of the class for you?
-	Which lesson has been your favorite so far? 
-	Is there anything you plan on using your learning for outside of class?
- Are there any activities you particularly enjoy during club? (e.g., code-along, Blooket)

### Student Experience Questions
These questions may help us improve the student's experience in club overall.

-	Is there anything you need from us?
-	Are there other areas you may need support?
-	What is something former teachers have done that have helped you stay on track with classes?
-	What is something former teachers have done that have helped you feel appreciated/celebrated?
-	What is your preferred method of talking during class?

### Random Questions
These are just here to break the ice, and might help get students talking. Try to figure out the student's interests; this can be quite difficult, but if you find that they are excited to talk about any of these topics, encourage that and continue it!

- What's the most recent song you listened to?
- What's the most recent YouTube video you watched?
- What's the last movie you saw in theaters?
- What's the _first_ movie you saw in theaters?
- Do you have any favorite TV shows?
- Have you been to any concerts?
- What types of websites do you visit?
- What's your favorite app on your phone?
- Have you been playing any video games lately?
- Do you play any sports or do any other extra curricular activities?
