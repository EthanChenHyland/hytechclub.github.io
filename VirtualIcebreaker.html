Feel free to mess with other settings as well!

## Drawing
Once everything is all set up, start drawing. Here are some ideas for what to draw:

- One of your favorite hobbies
- One of your favorite fictional characters
- A historical figure you admire
- An object you use every day

## Sharing
After about five minutes, you will be asked to share your drawing. You will introduce yourself, and tell the group what you drew.

One option is to [share your screen](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen-content-or-second-camera) in Zoom. If you are unable to do that, you can share a link to your drawing by following these steps:

1. In the bottom left, click the "Export" button
