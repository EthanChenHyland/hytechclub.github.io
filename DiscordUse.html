<blockquote>
<p>I agree and understand that Hyland may provide for the use of certain unaffiliated third party websites or applications (“Third Party Sites”) in connection with the Program. I understand that use of these Third Party Sites is optional. If I choose to permit my child(ren) to use such Third Party Sites, I further understand and agree that: (i) the Third Party Site may collect personal information directly from my child(ren) subject to the terms and conditions (including an applicable privacy policy) available on the Third Party Site; and (ii) Hyland does not control these Third Party Sites and is not responsible for their information collection practices. </p>

<li>The usage of Discord is <strong>not</strong> required. If you do not want to use it, you will still be able to participate in Hy-Tech Club.</li>
<li>You must use your <em>real first and last name</em> when communicating on Discord. If we see an account that does not have a real student name, the account will be kicked.</li>

<li>Please be respectful of all students and instructors while communicating on Discord.</li>
<li>Instructors will check Discord throughout the week during business hours, so feel free to post any time!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="server-categories-channels">Server Categories &amp; Channels</h2>
<p>We have one Discord Server for the whole of Hy-Tech Club. This means that students will be able to interact across courses.</p>
<p>There are several channels in the server. Please be mindful of each channel&#39;s purpose.</p>
<h3 id="all-category">ALL Category</h3>
<p>Channels in the <strong>ALL</strong> category are available to <em>all</em> students in Hy-Tech Club, from any course.</p>
<h4 id="announcements">announcements</h4>
<p>Instructors will post important messages in this channel. Students will not be able to post.</p>
<h4 id="chat">chat</h4>
<p>Students can use this channel to connect with each other socially. Conversations should be appropriate and relevant to the club, and can be a good way for students to get to know each other.</p>
<h4 id="status-updates">status-updates</h4>
<p>Use this channel for general updates. What&#39;s going on? Did you see a great movie recently? Any accomplishments you want to celebrate? Any thoughts you want to share? Any good (appropriate) jokes? It&#39;s all welcome here!</p>
<h4 id="counting">counting</h4>
<p>Exactly what it sounds like.</p>
<p>Rules: Only enter the next whole number (e.g., if the previous message was &quot;27&quot; you should enter &quot;28&quot;). Do not enter a number if you entered the most recent number. <strong>NEW THIS YEAR:</strong> if we mess up, the whole count restarts :)</p>
<h3 id="course-specific-categories">Course-Specific Categories</h3>
<p>There will be one category for each course. Each of these categories will contain channels specific to the students and instructors from the course.</p>
<h4 id="general">general</h4>
<p>This channel is reserved for general chat. It should mainly be used for conversations about Hy-Tech Club.</p>
<h4 id="questions">questions</h4>
<p>Students should ask questions related to course material in this channel. Instructors (and other students) will do their best to answer these questions. Note that the answers to the questions should be focused on learning; try to use leading questions or background explanations rather than simply providing a code solution.</p>
