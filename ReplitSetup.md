# Replit Setup
**Replit.com** is a website that allows developers to _write_ and _run_ code right from a web browser! Create a Replit account in order to save and share code projects.

>Note: throughout these instructions, there may be interactive Replit tutorials. Be sure to read through those helpful tips in addition to reading through this guide!

That's it! You now have a Repl account ðŸ˜Š

## Creating a Repl Project
On Replit, you can make a lot of different things. To work on something new, you'll want to create a **Repl Project** (also simply called a **Repl**). This will be where you store all of the code for your project, be it a website, C# application, or Python script!

1. On your [Repls](https://replit.com/repls) page, on the left side, click the "+ Create" button

1. Select a Template (like "HTML, CSS, JS")
1. Enter a Title for the Repl, like "Hello World"
1. Click the "+ Create Repl" button to create the new project!

That's it! You now have a Repl project ðŸ˜Š

## Repl Editor Overview
When opening a new Repl project for the first time, an interactive tutorial may appear. If that happens, be sure to read through the information; it will explain the how Replit works in detail.

Here is a quick rundown of the different areas of the Repl editor:

- **Files Area** - This is where developers select and update files
- **Code Editor** - This is where developers write code
- **Run Button** - Developers click this button to _execute_ the code
- **Run Area** - This is where the developer sees the results of the code

In the new repl, click the "Run" button to see the code execute. In the case of an **HTML, CSS, JS** repl, the page might say "Hello world" in the Run Area.

### TIP - Boiler-plate Code
At the moment, there may be some "boiler-plate" code in the editor. Don't worry about that for now; you do not need to understand any of it yet!

## Conclusion
At this point you should be good to go, and ready to start developing on Replit! Make sure to remember your Replit username and password - those credentials will allow you to keep track of all your projects ðŸ˜Š
