  - A Chromebook screen may make it difficult to watch the Zoom meeting and code at the same time. A second device may be recommended in order to do both at the same time. 
- **Microphone or other audio equipment**
  - If students don't have a microphone attached to their computer, they are required to connect to audio via phone.

Our goal is to make decisions as quickly as possible, so everyone has enough time to plan for the upcoming semester. **The semester will start on February 16 or 17, depending on your course assignment.**
