    - Dinner will be served for students in-person at Hyland from 5-5:30PM ET.

## Spring 2024 Course Offerings
We are planning to offer all courses in a _hybrid_ format - so you can join either in-person in Westlake or virtually through Zoom. View more information about course offerings on [our website](https://www.hyland.com/en/explore/hy-tech/Tech-outreach-overview/club).

- **Web 101:** HTML & CSS
- **Web 102:** Introduction to JavaScript
- **Web 103:** Advanced JavaScript

_The above course offerings are subject to change based on enrollment for Spring 2024. If there are not enough students to fill a course section, the course may be cancelled and students will be notified._

### ðŸŒŸ New this year: Legacy Club Membership
If you've already taken all the courses we're offering, or if you simply aren't interested in taking them, we have a new option for former students this semester!

Rather than sitting in an instructor-led classroom, you'll be able to engage asynchronously through our Discord server. There, you'll have the opportunity to work with former classmates and new students, all while retaining access to the support of Hyland instructors. There will hopefully be opportunities for mentorship, project-based learning, and community development throughout the semester.

Just as a note, we've never done anything like this before! So we're going to figure it out as we go. We just wanted to provide a way for all of our former students to stay involved, especially those who already have extensive programming skills and want to grow beyond our course offerings.

### Which course are you eligible to take as a former student?

<ins>**If you most recently took Web 101:**</ins>
- **Web 101** may be recommended for students who could benefit from retaking the course
- **Web 102** may be recommended for students who are ready to begin learning JavaScript
- **Web 103** may be recommended for students who already have knowledge of JavaScript

<ins>**If you most recently took Web 102:**</ins>
- **Web 102** may be recommended for students who could benefit from retaking the course
- **Web 103** may be recommended for students who would like to learn more advanced JavaScript concepts

<ins>**If you most recently took any other course:**</ins>
- **Web 103** may be recommended for students who have not yet taken it
- **Legacy Club Membership** may be the recommendation for students who have taken all courses already

We may recommend students retake a course to ensure all students fully understand what they are learning. It may also be recommended that students take an online assessment to gauge whether or not they are ready to move on to the next class. We are truly invested in making sure you have a valuable experience in Hy-Tech Club, and hope you feel we are setting you up for success. If you have any questions regarding your course placement for this semester, please do not hesitate to send us an e-mail at **[techoutreach@hyland.com](mailto:techoutreach@hyland.com)**.

### Required Resources for Virtual Students
In order to successfully participate in Virtual Hy-Tech Club, students must have access to the following:

- **Internet**
- **Laptop, desktop PC or Chromebook**
  - A Chromebook screen may make it difficult to watch the Zoom meeting and code at the same time. A second device may be recommended in order to do both at the same time. 
- **Microphone and Webcam**
  - If students don't have a microphone attached to their computer, they are required to connect to audio via phone.  Students will be required to have a webcam turned on during the meeting (bandwidth permitting). If they do not have one, Hyland can provide one for them. 

**Applications open on a date to be determined. Applications are due by 11:59PM ET on a date to be determined.** Students will be sent a confirmation that their application has been received (<ins>via the e-mail addresses on their application</ins>) within 5-7 business days of their submission. We will review all applications and consult with your former instructors _(if applicable)_ to make sure the best decision is made for your learning path. Our goal is to make decisions as quickly as possible, so everyone has enough time to plan for the upcoming semester. **The semester will start on Tuesday, February 20th, 2024.**

Applications are open to the public, and we encourage you to tell your friends & family about Hy-Tech Club. Please direct them to [www.hyland.com/techoutreach](https://hyland.com/techoutreach) for more information.

Thank you!
