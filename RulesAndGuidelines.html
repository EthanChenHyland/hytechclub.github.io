<h1 id="rules-guidelines">Rules &amp; Guidelines</h1>
<p>Be sure to follow all of the rules and guidelines below when participating in Hy-Tech Club.</p>
<h2 id="basic-rules">Basic Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li>Attend meetings every week, and email <a href="mailto:techoutreach@hyland.com">techoutreach@hyland.com</a> to notify us if you will miss a week</li>
<li>Speak up and let instructors know if they are moving too quickly</li>
<li>Do not say or do anything you would not do in a school classroom</li>
<li>If attending virtually, respond to private messages in the Zoom chat</li>
<li>Pay attention and follow along during the meeting</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="escalation-plan">Escalation Plan</h2>
<p>Your success is our highest priority. If we find that you are struggling, we will do our best to remedy the issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is a problem, such as misbehavior or unresponsiveness, we will begin by having a conversation with you during class</li>
<li>If the issue continues, we will follow up by e-mailing you and your parent/guardian</li>
<li>If we have any persistent issues, we will reach out to your parent/guardian directly</li>
</ul>
<p>This plan is not in place to punish you; we just want to do everything you can to make sure you and your fellow students have a positive learning experience.</p>
<h2 id="virtual-club-screen-sharing-or-multiplayer-replit">Virtual Club: Screen Sharing OR Multiplayer Replit</h2>
<p>We expect <strong>ALL</strong> students to share their progress during self-paced work. This will allow the instructors to help each student, and have some visibility into how the class is doing overall. If you would like, you can choose to share only one window of your screen (e.g. a browser window). We do not want to spy on you; we just want to make sure we can see how you are doing!</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen">this guide</a> for more information about screen sharing in Zoom.</p>
<h3 id="multiplayer-replit">Multiplayer Replit</h3>
<p>Another option, if the course uses <a href="https://replit.com">Replit</a>, is to share a <a href="https://replit.com/site/multiplayer">Multiplayer</a> Repl link.</p>
<h2 id="virtual-club-device-guidelines-for-zoom-meetings">Virtual Club: Device Guidelines for Zoom Meetings</h2>
<p>We encourage you to use whatever device setup works best for you. That said, we also ask that all students follow some basic guidelines when joining the Zoom meetings.</p>
<h3 id="webcams">Webcams</h3>
<p>We understand that not all students have webcams, but if you do, please keep your webcam <strong>on</strong>. This makes it much easier for your instructors to teach.</p>
<p>We ask that you either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn on your video</li>
<li>Set a profile picture for your Zoom account</li>
</ul>
<p>This will help the instructors get to know you better on an individual basis.</p>
<h4 id="virtual-background">Virtual Background</h4>
<p>If you would like, check out <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/210707503-Virtual-Background#:~:text=Zoom%20desktop%20client.-,Click%20Settings.,image%20by%20clicking%20%2BAdd%20Image.">this guide</a> to see how you can add a virtual background to your video.</p>
<h4 id="profile-picture">Profile Picture</h4>
<p>If you do not have a webcam, check out <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201363203-Customizing-your-profile">this guide</a> to see how you can change the picture on your profile. <a href="https://zoom.us/profile">Click here</a> to go to your profile online.</p>
<h3 id="microphones">Microphones</h3>
<p>We understand that some students may not have microphones. If you do not have a microphone, you can <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362663-Joining-a-meeting-by-phone">call in</a> to the Zoom meeting on a regular telephone. This will enable instructors and students to converse with less difficulty.</p>
<h4 id="during-lectures-and-code-along-activities">During Lectures and Code-Along Activities</h4>
<p>Microphones should stay <strong>muted</strong> during lectures and code-along activities. This will help every student learn more effectively. If an instructor asks a question to the class during these activities, please <strong>unmute</strong> your microphone to answer rather than typing into the chat.</p>
<h4 id="chat">Chat</h4>
<p>Chat should be used to ask questions when microphones are muted. If microphones are <em>not</em> muted, please do <strong>not</strong> use chat to converse. It is much easier to have a conversation through audio than through chat.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-devices">Multiple Devices</h3>
<p>It may make sense for you to use multiple devices: one to write code, and one to watch the Zoom meeting. This will give you more room to write code while still viewing the instructor&#39;s screen. It is not required, but it may make your experience better overall.</p>
<p>If you decide to use multiple devices, we ask that you connect to Zoom on both devices. This way, you will be able to share your screen from your coding computer while watching the meeting on the other device. Please ensure that only <strong>one</strong> microphone is unmuted throughout the meeting to avoid interference.</p>
