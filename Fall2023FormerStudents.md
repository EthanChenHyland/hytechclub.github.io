### Required Resources for Virtual Students
In order to successfully participate in Virtual Hy-Tech Club, students must have access to the following:

- **Internet**
- **Laptop, desktop PC or Chromebook**
  - A Chromebook screen may make it difficult to watch the Zoom meeting and code at the same time. A second device may be recommended in order to do both at the same time. 
- **Microphone and Webcam**
  - If students don't have a microphone attached to their computer, they are required to connect to audio via phone.  Students will be required to have a webcam turned on during the meeting. If they do not have one, Hyland can provide one for them. 

**Applications open on Thursday, August 24th. Applications are due by 11:59PM ET Thursday, September 14th.** Students will be sent a confirmation that their application has been received (<ins>via the e-mail addresses on their application</ins>) within 5-7 business days of their submission. We will review all applications and consult with your former instructors _(if applicable)_ to make sure the best decision is made for your learning path. Our goal is to make decisions as quickly as possible, so everyone has enough time to plan for the upcoming semester. **The semester will start on Tuesday, September 19th, 2023.**

Applications are open to the public, and we encourage you to tell your friends & family about Hy-Tech Club. Please direct them to [www.hyland.com/techoutreach](https://hyland.com/techoutreach) for more information.
