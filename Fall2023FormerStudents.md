## Fall 2023 Course Offerings
View more information about course offerings on [our website](https://www.hyland.com/en/explore/hy-tech/Tech-outreach-overview/club).

- **Hybrid Web 101:** HTML & CSS (in-person OR virtual)
- **Virtual Web 102:** Introduction to JavaScript (virtual ONLY)
  - This course covers the JavaScript programming language in depth, and introduces general programming concepts. By the end of the semester, students will be familiar with basic programming, and will be able to use JavaScript to add interactivity to webpages. Students will attend Virtual Web 102 virtually via Zoom.
- **Hybrid Software Development Capstone** (in-person OR virtual)
  - In the capstone course, students will work on one long-term project for the entirety of the semester. There may be some instructor-led lessons scattered throughout the course, but most of the time will be spent working individually or as teams to build software applications. Students can attend Hybrid Software Development Capston in-person or virtually.
  - This course will be offered to students that are self-motivated, hard-working, and up for the challenge. Should a student wish to apply for Capstone, the Tech Outreach team will consult with the student's former instructors to determine if the student would be a good fit for the course. If an applicant is not a former Hy-Tech Club student, skill assessments may be given to determine if this is the best option for them.

_The above course offerings are subject to change based on enrollment for Fall 2023. If there are not enough students to fill a course section, the course may be cancelled and students will be notified._

### Required Resources for Virtual Students
In order to successfully participate in Virtual Hy-Tech Club, students must have access to the following:

- **Internet**
- **Laptop, desktop PC or Chromebook**
  - A Chromebook screen may make it difficult to watch the Zoom meeting and code at the same time. A second device may be recommended in order to do both at the same time. 
- **Microphone and Webcam**
  - If students don't have a microphone attached to their computer, they are required to connect to audio via phone.  Students will be required to have a webcam turned on during the meeting. If they do not have one, Hyland can provide one for them. 

**Applications open on Thursday, August 24th. Applications are due by 11:59PM ET Thursday, September 14th.** Students will be sent a confirmation that their application has been received (<ins>via the e-mail addresses on their application</ins>) within 5-7 business days of their submission. We will review all applications and consult with your former instructors _(if applicable)_ to make sure the best decision is made for your learning path. Our goal is to make decisions as quickly as possible, so everyone has enough time to plan for the upcoming semester. **The semester will start on Tuesday, September 19th, 2023.**

Applications are open to the public, and we encourage you to tell your friends & family about Hy-Tech Club. Please direct them to [www.hyland.com/techoutreach](https://hyland.com/techoutreach) for more information.
