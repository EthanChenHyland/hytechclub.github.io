# Room Setup: First Night
If possible, try to setup your room _before_ 4:45pm. That way, you can head to the Employee & Training Entrance to help with ushering duties.

If not, you should still arrive to the entrance at 4:45pm. Grab your lanyard!

Head to your room around 5:00pm after taking a group or two - as long as there is ushering coverage.

To set up your room:

- Make sure there is candy
- Make sure there is card stock / markers for name tents
- Plug your laptop into the dock
- Test that the projector shows up as a duplicate of the monitor on the podium
- Use your laptop screen for notes
- Join the Zoom meeting for your course
- Test Zoom video/audio
- Pull up a welcome screen of some kind (even just a text file)
- Share screen with sound and play some music

Once the room has been setup, be sure to head to the auditorium before 5:25pm for instructor introductions.

Once instructor intros are complete, head back to your room. This will allow you to greet virtual participants when the join the zoom, and greet in-person students when they get done washing their hands and enter the room. Once they enter, tell them to make name tents and find seats toward the front.
