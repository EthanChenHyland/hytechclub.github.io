Yeah!

- When there is a group of 5-10 students present, tell them to follow you and you'll take them to get drinks/dinner
- Lead them down the hall, past the auditorium
- If they don't want a drink, you can drop them off at the auditorium
- If they do, take them to the break room on the first floor
- Make sure if they get drinks, they use the coffee cups and put lids on them
- Once everyone has drinks, lead them back to the auditorium
- If someone has to go to the bathroom, ensure there are at least two instructors present, and wait for them outside  
    - Note they will have an opportunity to go to the bathroom after dinner
- Once all students have been dropped in the auditorium, head back to the entrance and wait for another group

Depending on coverage needs, you can head to the auditorium for dinner around 5:10pm.
