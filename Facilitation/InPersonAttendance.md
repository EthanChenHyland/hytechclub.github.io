# In-Person Attendance: First Night
Bring your laptop, and arrive to the Employee & Training Entrance by 4:45pm.

## Preparation
On your laptop:

- Bring up the [Attendance Sheet](https://hylandsw-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/caitlin_nowlin_hyland_com/Documents/Spring%202024%20Hy-Tech%20Club/Spring%202024%20Hy-Tech%20Club%20Attendance.xlsx?d=wb72628f5517947b69b0fa5342397770f&csf=1&web=1&e=W8h2qN)
- Bring up HSIDB, go to Document Retrieval, and select the **APP - Parent Consent Form** document type  
    - This will be used to verify late-submitted forms

Prop open the outer door, and have the door lock clicker handy (doors should lock at 5pm).

Grab a nametag and write your name in big letters.

## Student Arrivals
As students enter the building, welcome them as follows:

- Ask if they are here for Hy-Tech Club
- If they are, ask them what course they are taking (if they don't know, it's probably Web 101)
- Ask for their first and last name
- On the [attendance sheet](https://hylandsw-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/caitlin_nowlin_hyland_com/Documents/Spring%202024%20Hy-Tech%20Club/Spring%202024%20Hy-Tech%20Club%20Attendance.xlsx?d=wb72628f5517947b69b0fa5342397770f&csf=1&web=1&e=W8h2qN), try to locate them
- If they have a completed consent form:  
    - Mark them present
    - Tell them to wait for a bit until it's time to take a group
- If they do NOT have a completed consent form:  
    - Tell them they will need a parent or guardian to complete one
    - A parent/guardian can find the form link on [hylandtechclub.com](https://hylandtechclub.com/)
    - Check HSIDB to see if the form has been submitted:
        - If so, they are good to go
        - If not, they cannot participate in club

## Closing Up
If all students have arrived, or if it's past 5:15pm, head to the auditorium!
