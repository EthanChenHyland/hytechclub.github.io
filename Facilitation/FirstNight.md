# First Night Facilitation
Depending on your assigned duties, you'll want to make sure you know what to do. Everyone should be at the Employee & Training Entrance by 4:45pm, and should grab a nametag and write their name in big letters.

Instructor introductions will take place in the OSU Auditorium at 5:25pm - so make sure to be in there by then!

Here are more details for different responsibilities:

- [Attendance](InPersonAttendance.md)
- [Usher](Usher.md) - this is the default duty for every instructor
- [Room Setup](RoomSetup.md) 

At the end of the night, at least one instructor should lead the students from the classroom to the exit. Additional instructors should clean up the room.

Please reach out to Joseph or Caitlin with any questions.
