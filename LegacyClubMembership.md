# Legacy Club Membership
_An opportunity for former Hy-Tech Club members to continue their involvement beyond enrollment in instructor-led courses_

## Who
This is for former Hy-Tech Club students who have completed all current courses, or have requisite knowledge.

## Where
Some options will allow students to join the club at Hyland HQ in Westlake. All options will be available virtually through Zoom. Primary communication will take place asynchronously on Discord.

## What
There are a few options for legacy students depending on their interest.

### Option One: Teaching Assistance
For this option, you will join a course's instructor team as a Teaching Assistant. You will help students of the course during self-paced work time - primarily focusing on things like explaining code, debugging issues, and providing encouragement. You may also have an opportunity to lead code-along activities or present lectures.

This is a chance to really strengthen your fundamental computer science skills, and branch out into mentorship.

### Option Two: Software Development Project
For this option, you will work on a long-term software development project of your choosing. You are welcome to work alone, or work with others. You can build anything you'd like - a video game, a website, a mobile application, or anything else - but it should be something you really want to build. Hy-Tech Club instructors will be available from a support perspective, but they will have minimal oversight.

If you have always wanted to make something, this can be a great opportunity to bring your idea to life!

>Note: This option may not be available in-person depending on instructor capacity

### Option Three: Research Project
For this option, you will help the Hyland Tech Outreach team by doing some research for us. The topics could be things like new technologies, online IDEs, how to integrate AI into our lessons, current career pathways for computer science, engagement strategies for Gen Z, or something else to be determined. This will directly benefit us, and will contribute significantly to our cause.

If you want to support the mission of Tech Outreach, this would be a great way to do it!

>Note: This option may not be available in-person depending on instructor capacity

### Option Four: Dinner Presentations
Way back in the day, during the dinner portion of club, we used to show videos or allow employees to present on a topic relevant to technology. For this option, we'd bring that back, and allow _you_ to share something cool with the whole group! Topics could range from bleeding edge emerging technologies, cool futurist thought experiments, your own passion for programming, speedrunning hacks, software history, or really anything else that vaguely relates to computer science.

This will give you a chance to stretch your presentation skills, and share your perspective on some tech-related things.

### Option Five: Something Else?
If you have any other ideas, please let us know! This is the first time we have offered this track, so we are open to suggestions.

## Why
We want to continue our support of students who may not benefit from further instructor-led courses. We hope you are excited to continue your involvement with the club!
