# Online IDEs
In order to successfully facilitate our variety of long-term programs, an online IDE is essential. This allows us to offer programs using any devices (laptops, desktops, chromebooks) and allow students to save and share their work online. While online IDEs may not be the most powerful development environments available, they are flexible and scalable to our needs, and they may be the future of development in general. Of all the available online IDEs, [Replit](https://replit.com/) has been the best we have found.

## [Replit](https://docs.replit.com/getting-started/intro-replit)
There are a number of features that make Replit uniquely suited for the needs of the Tech Outreach team.

- Built-in Database
- Environment Variables (Secrets)
- Multiple languages including Python and C#
- Live Collaboration (Multiplayer)
- Active Community
- Account required
- GitHub Integration
- Built-in Tutorials designed for beginners
- Direct access to the terminal
- Familiarity/Ease of Use

## [StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/guides/user-guide/what-is-stackblitz)
StackBlitz is perhaps the second-best option for our programs, and we do use it for [our HTML/CSS activity](https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/coding-activities/). It has:

- VS Code development environment + settings
- Project Freezing
- Built-in preview console
- No account required for basic use
- GitHub Integration

However, it is missing some key features from Replit, including:

- Languages beyond only web development
- A simple and positive experience for beginners

## [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)
CodePen is nice for a number of reasons, but it has some significant shortfalls for long-term use:

- Adding assets (e.g. images, uploading files) is not available in the free version
- Collab Mode is not available in the free version
- Live View is not available in the free version
- Editor is not ideal - only allows for one HTML, CSS, and JS section

One nice thing is that no login is required.

## [Visual Studio Code for Web](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/10/20/vscode-dev)
This platform has no easy way to render webpages.

## [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/deep-dive)
GitHub Codespaces is incredibly powerful, but setting up an environment for rendering/hosting is complex. This may be an option for more advanced courses, but it does not make sense for most of our programs.

## [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com/)
Glitch is another site that works fairly well for our needs. It is similar to Replit in many ways, and has these features:

- No account required for basic editing
- There is a community aspect

However, there are some pitfalls that make Glitch unsuitable for us:

- Only web languages
- More difficult to share code collaboration
- Adding assets is via CDN - not direct files (not as fun)
- No editor settings
- No built-in console
- No color picker
- No autocomplete
- No Run button
- Automatic indenting is confusing

## [CodeCollab](https://codecollab.io/)
CodeCollab is unavailable for HTML/CSS/JS.
